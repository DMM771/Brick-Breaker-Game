<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Brick Breaker Game is a dynamic and engaging JAVA-based game that demonstrates the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and makes heavy use of the Observer design pattern, along with mechanics physics. The game features various interactive objects like bricks, balls, and levels, each designed with deeper underlying objects such as level objects, background objects, Collidable objects, points, lines, and animations.</p>

<p>The game's physics rely on vectors and mathematical calculations, with each ball having a current position and a trajectory (position in the next frame). The game's animation loop calculates potential collisions and bounces using line objects that represent the ball's movement. Complex collision scenarios, including ball bounces and brick destruction, are handled efficiently through the listener design pattern.</p>

<p>One of the unique challenges addressed in this game is the collision detection and response in corner areas, which was solved with an advanced algorithm to prevent undefined game states. This project is not only a showcase of advanced programming techniques but also offers a fun and immersive gaming experience.</p>
